<p>Did you know that North Seattle College does not have an official mascot?!
Itâ€™s true, and a growing contingent of students, staff, and faculty would like to see the Pacific Tree Frog, also known as the Pacific Chorus Frog, adopted as our new school mascot.
Hereâ€™s why these cute little frogs make a great candidate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are the perfect icon for a College:  In cultures around the world, frogs are held as symbols of personal rebirth and change, along with wealth and abundance.</li>
  <li>They are symbols of environmental stewardship: They are scientifically classified as keystone species, are officially designated as an indicator species, and are symbols of the global environmental movement.</li>
  <li>Pacific Chorus Frogs are often found in the gardens and woodland areas on campus and have occupied this landscape for thousands of years.</li>
  <li>Theyâ€™re cute!</li>
</ul>
