<p>Did you know that North Seattle College does not have an official mascot?!
It’s true, and a growing contingent of students, staff, and faculty would like to see the Pacific Tree Frog, also known as the Pacific Chorus Frog, adopted as our new school mascot.
Here’s why these cute little frogs make a great candidate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are the perfect icon for a College:  In cultures around the world, frogs are held as symbols of personal rebirth and change, along with wealth and abundance.</li>
  <li>They are symbols of environmental stewardship: They are scientifically classified as keystone species, are officially designated as an indicator species, and are symbols of the global environmental movement.</li>
  <li>Pacific Chorus Frogs are often found in the gardens and woodland areas on campus and have occupied this landscape for thousands of years.</li>
  <li>They’re cute!</li>
</ul>
