## Why should we change the mascot?
* NSC doesn't currently have an official mascot
* Pacifc Tree Frogs, also known as Pacific Chorus Frogs are universal symbols of change, rebirth and personal growth
* Pacific Tree Frogs live in the wetlands and woodlands on our campus, making them an ideal candidate to represent our school
* If the pacific tree frogs become our mascot, it will ensure their protection for years and decades to come

## What do they do for us?

* They have provided us with medical advances
* Their tadpoles filter our drinking water
* Ensuring the protection of the tree frogs will ensure the protection of their habitat
